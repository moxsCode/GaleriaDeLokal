System: Qr-Code Verification to View Different Artworks
The use of QR codes in gallery exhibits has become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to
enhance the viewing experience for visitors and provide valuable information about artwork. One of the
key advantages of using QR codes in gallery exhibits is that they provide a seamless way to deliver
information to visitors without cluttering the physical space with signage or text panels. Users can simply
scan the QR code and instantly access a wealth of information about the artwork they are viewing. This not
only enhances their understanding and appreciation of the piece but also allows them to delve deeper into
the artist's background and creative process.
The inclusion of a simple verification system using five-digit integer numbers adds an extra layer of
security and control to the QR code access. This verification process ensures that only authorized
individuals are granted access to the main tab or additional content. The QR code scanner can check if the
scanned code matches the one stored in the database, and based on the verification result, it can either grant
access to the main tab or display a dialog indicating that the code is not a match.
The system's ability to display a dialog box when an incorrect or unmatched QR code is scanned
helps maintain the integrity of the exhibition and protect the content from unauthorized access. This feature
can be especially useful in situations where there are restricted areas or premium content that should only be
accessible to certain individuals.
In conclusion, the use of QR codes in gallery exhibits can greatly enhance the viewing experience
for visitors by providing easy access to additional information about the artwork. The inclusion of a
verification system adds an extra layer of security and control, ensuring that only authorized individuals can
access certain content. This technology benefits both visitors and artists/galleries by deepening the
understanding of the artwork and providing valuable insights for future exhibitions.
