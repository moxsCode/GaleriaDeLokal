# GaleriaDeLokal
Developed a Java-based application using NetBeans that showcases artworks from local artists. The system integrates a QR code authentication feature, allowing users to scan a unique code before accessing the gallery. Once inside, users can browse collections of artworks, view artist details, and navigate through the exhibit digitally.
